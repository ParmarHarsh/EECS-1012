        <h1> Welcome to my first website</h1>
        <h2> My Name is Harsh Parmar</h2>
        <p> I know EECS1012 is a challenging course, and i need to <strong>engage</strong> really well in problem solving activities from first week of classes for every week.</p>
        <p> I have been told that if I treat 1012, 1022, 2030, and 2011 each as 6-credit course, and really learn the underlying concepts and skills, I will enjoy rest of my CS program. 
            In fact <u>rest of my life! as long as I am in the CS business</u>.
